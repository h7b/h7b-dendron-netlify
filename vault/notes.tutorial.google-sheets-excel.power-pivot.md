# Power Pivot - Data Model in Excel

ref: [goskills](https://www.goskills.com/Excel/Resources/Power-query-vs-power-pivot-power-bi), [The White Pages](https://whitepages.unlimitedviz.com/2021/03/its-time-to-stop-using-power-pivot/), [fluentpro](https://fluentpro.com/blog/difference-between-power-pivot-power-query-and-power-bi), [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-power-query-and-power-pivot-work-together-a5f52cba-2150-4fc0-bb8f-b21d69990bc0)

Power Pivot is an in-memory data modeling component that provides highly compressed data storage and extremely fast aggregation and calculation. Power Pivot is used to model your data and perform more complex calculations than Excel can handle.

Power Pivot is great when working with huge data sets. Once Power Query has imported and cleaned the various data sources, Power Pivot is used to establish relationships between the tables/queries.

With DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), the formula language of Power Pivot, you can create more powerful calculations and more sophisticated data models than you can in Excel alone.

The Power Pivot window has two views. The Data view looks similar to Excel and enables you to see your data and create calculated columns and measures using DAX formulas.  
![power-pivot-data-view](https://cdn2.goskills.com/blobs/blogs/305/31283917-5cd9-4a01-b775-85c012c96835.png){max-width: 300px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}

And the Diagram view where you can establish the relationships between your tables.

The connectors in the `Diagram View` have a "1" on one side, and an "*" on the other. This means that there is a `one-to-many` relationship between the tables, and that determines how the data is used in your PivotTables.

When your model is set up, you can analyze and report on your data using [PivotTables](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-pivottable-to-analyze-worksheet-data-a9a84538-bfe9-40a9-a8e9-f99134456576)

## Power Query, Power Pivot, Power BI, What to use when?

Power Query and Power Pivot complement each other. Use both to shape your data in Excel so you can explore and visualize it in PivotTables, PivotCharts, and Power BI
- Power Query is the recommended tool for locating, connecting to and importing data. 
- Power Pivot: is great for modeling the data youâ€™ve imported

|   | Power Query | Power Pivot | Desktop & PowerBI.com |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Role | Import and shape data | Data modeling and calculations | Complete business intelligence tool |
| Language | M | DAX | M and DAX |
| Key strengths | - Nice easy to use interface<br>- Powerful tools to import and clean data<br>- All Excel users can benefit from this tool | - Easily handle millions of rows of data<br>- Modeling tools for efficient data storage and analysis<br>- Powerful DAX calculations going beyond standard Excel | - Incredible visualization options<br>- Simple built-in interactive options<br>- Powerful DAX calculations<br>- Simple publishing to PowerBI.com and mobile devices |

    - in Microsoft 365, both SharePoint Online and Excel Web App limit the size of an Excel file to 10 MB
    - Data models in Excel use the in-memory analytics engine to store data in memory. On average, you can expect a data model to be 7 to 10 times smaller than the same data at its point of origin

    - The VertiPaq Engine in DAX. VertiPaq is an in-memory columnar database. Being in-memory means that all of the data handled by a model reside in RAM
    - In a columnar database, data is organized in such a way to optimize vertical scanning. To obtain this result, you need a way to make the different values of a column adjacent one to the other
