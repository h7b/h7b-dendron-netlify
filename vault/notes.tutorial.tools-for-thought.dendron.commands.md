# Frequently used commands

## When I need to refactor notes
ref: [Dendron wiki](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/0fFWWockAV3L7mMMJOyGF/), [Dendron discord](https://discord.com/channels/717965437182410783/735365126227493004/919354849668251688)

- `Dendron: Rename Note`: Renames a single note
- `Dendron: Move Note`: Moves a single note to a different vault, can rename during move
- `Dendron: Refactor Hierarchy`: When you wish to rename a collection of notes at one time by changing pieces of the hierarchy

Some slight differences, but they also all include updating backlinks referencing the note. Refactoring is the most powerful one, and is able to do the most at one time.

## Sync all notes with git
