# Discounted Cash Flow Model
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp)

Discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis attempts to figure out the value of an investment today, based on projections of how much money it will generate in the future.

## Formula

$$DCF = \frac{CF_1}{1+r^1} + \frac{CF_2}{1+r^2} + ... + \frac{CF_n}{1+r^n}$$

where
- $CF =$ the cash flow for the given year
  - $CF_1 =$ the cash flow for the 1st year
  - $CF_2 =$ the cash flow for the 2nd year
  - $CF_n =$ the cash flow for the year $n^{th}$
- $r =$ the discount rate
  - Companies typically use the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the discount rate, because it takes into consideration the rate of return expected by shareholders

## What DCF Can Tell You

The purpose of DCF analysis is to estimate the money an investor would receive from an investment, adjusted for the time value of money. The time value of money assumes that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow because it can be invested.
