# VNDC

## Overview

VNDC is a [[stablecoin|notes.p-fin.r.2022-06-06.stablecoin]] pegged to the Vietnam dong at a 1:1 ratio (1 VNDC = 1 VND), issued by [[notes.p-fin.r.2022-06-06.onus]], which is incorporated in Singapore.

## Thoughts

[[notes.p-fin.r.2022-06-06.onus]] did not publish their periodic report related to the collateral assets to insure the VNDC peg. What is the constitution of these assets? They are escrowed by which entities?

I don't understand how can they gain the trust of new user.
