# Write notes in Dendron

[[Workflow|notes.tutorial.tools-for-thought.dendron.deploy-netlify]] to publish vault by deploying via Netlify and notes stored in GitHub private repo.
- My favorite method
- Much better, both in execution time, number of keystroke, size of local folder on disk and manual effort, vs the workflow of publishing via GitHub Pages
- with this Netlify workflow, I just need to push updated contents to GitHub repo with command `Dendron: Workspace: Sync`, and all of the built process will be executed automatically by Netlify.
