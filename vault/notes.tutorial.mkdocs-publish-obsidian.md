# Publish Obsidian vault using MkDocs

## Thoughts:

Workflow: 
- Write notes in Obsidian
- Prepare files to publish with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
- Deploy in GitHub Pages
    
Discussion of workflow in [Obsidian forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/my-obsidian-mkdocs-workflow/24424)

Showcase: [Tarek Shehata](https://tarekshehata.github.io/alkashi/Math/Basic%20Shapes/Circle/)

Thoughts:
- My current favorite if I need to publish my Obsidian vault
- has dark theme, built-in navigation bar, search feature, `Next` and `Previous` UI links at the end of each doc page
- open source, static site generator, documents are markdown md files
- has [guide](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/adding-a-comment-system/) to integrate [[3rd party comment system|notes.tutorial.comments-static-site]]
- Suitable for technical project documentation.
- tags in notes supported only in [Insider tier](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-tags/)
- Diagrams with `mermaid.js` supported only in [Insider tier](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/diagrams/0)
- [Insider sponsorship](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/diagrams/) starts at USD 10 / month.
