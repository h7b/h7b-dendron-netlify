## Notes from reading

- *DEBITS* represent the flow of economic benefit to a destination
- *CREDITS* represent the flow of economic benefit from a source

I also found this is a better way to interpret the basic equation of Accounting.

Assets = Liabilities + Equity

Assets = Liabilities + (Owner's Equity - Dividends + Retained Earnings)

Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity - Dividends + (Revenue - Expenses)

or rewrite as:

Assets + Dividends + Expenses = Liabilities + Owner's Equity + Revenue

which leads to
- the accounts on the left side of equation *INCREASE* when *DEBITED*
- the accounts on the right side of equation *INCREASE* when *CREDITED*

or a trick to memorize when to Debit/Credit

There are 2 definitions of *Equity*
1. *Equity* is the residual value of an entity's *Assets* after deducting all of its *Liabilities*  
  or the basic equation: Equity = Assets - Liabilities
2. *Equity* represents the net funds invested into a business by its owners
  or Equity = Capital Contributions + Retained Earnings
