## Thoughts

My thoughts on Version: 2.0.0-beta.13

Pros:
- generate documents as a Single Page Application (SPA), dark mode
- Has sidebar navigation, menu bar, search bar, admonition, i18n built-in ([crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) plugin or alternative locale markdown files), `Next` and `Previous` UI links at the end of each doc page
- has url slug in frontmatter to generate a static URL for each md file

Cons:
- when I reorganize the hierarchy structure of md files (ie. move to other folder, rename folder that contains md files, rename md files) in `docs` folder, I need to manually  
    - update doc IDs in my sidebar file, since notes hierarchy structure are hardcoded in sidebar file for sidebar for navigation
    - update the reference links to other markdown files 
- does not support wikilink style, need custom script to convert to markdown link. Or use a [plugin](https://github.com/ozntel/obsidian-link-converter) in Obsidian to convert the link in notes within your vault.
