U.S. Inflation-Protected Bonds: 1.02%

U.S. Municipal Bonds: 5.82%
MUB
iShares National AMT-Free
TFI
SPDR Nuveen Bloomberg
U.S. Municipal Bonds are only included in taxable portfolios, since the interest from them is generally federally tax-exempt. The underlying bonds are issued by state and regional governments to finance capital expenditures, such as infrastructure spending. While municipal bond credit risk is slightly higher than risk-free U.S. Treasuries, it still remains very low, which is attractive for risk-averse investors. This characteristic, coupled with favorable federal tax treatment, makes municipal bonds an excellent addition to taxable portfolios.
MUB is the primary ETF used to gain exposure to U.S. Municipal Bonds, due to its relatively high liquidity.
The secondary ETF, TFI, is similar to MUB but has a slightly higher bid-ask spread.

U.S. High Quality Bonds: 1.57%
