# List of Web Browsers

[Bonsai](https://bonsaibrowser.com/)  
Thougths: still cannot understand what's the usecase of this app. Uninstall

[Opera](https://www.opera.com/)  
Thoughts: I use [Flow](https://www.opera.com/features/flow) feature to share links between Opera on my laptop and [Opera on my iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1411869974).

[Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)  
Thoughts: 
- I use both the normal and [insider channel](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download/)
- normal for temporary view, where cookies and tmp files will be deleted on closing browser
- Beta channel for media consuming
- Dev channel as personal workspace

[Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)  
Thoughts: I install both the normal and [Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/)

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)  
Thoughts: I install both the normal and [Chrome Beta](https://www.google.com/chrome/beta/)

[Aloha Browser](https://alohabrowser.com/)
Thoughts: serve as my main browser on iOS. I also test their [desktop version](https://alohabrowser.com/pc/). Though the sync features between mobile and desktop is not ready to use (2021-12-17). Chromium.

[Brave](https://brave.com/)  
Thoughts: just use by curiosity. Nothing too impressive. Chromium

[Dot Browser](https://www.dothq.co/en)  
Thoughts: based on Firefox. Privacy-focused browser

[Iridium Browser](https://iridiumbrowser.de/)  
Thoughts: Privacy-focused browser. Don't have auto update feature. Chromium

[Sidekick](https://www.meetsidekick.com/)  
Thoughts: browser designed for work? I still cannot understand their unique selling point. Chromium

[Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/)  
Thoughts: Privacy-focused browser. Chromium

[Waterfox](https://www.waterfox.net/)  
Thoughts: based on Firefox. Privacy-focused browser

[Stack](https://stackbrowser.com/)  
Thoughts: [Pricing plan] starts at USD 8.4/month, with free tier. Can open multiple accounts (eg. gmail) in one instance.

[Webcatalog](https://webcatalog.io/webcatalog/)  
Thoughts: it has the same usecase as [Stack](https://stackbrowser.com/)

[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/download/)  
Thoughts: against tracking, surveillance, and censorship. I use it to search for academic articles on Sci-Hub, [Library Genesis](http://libgen.li/), [Z Library](https://z-lib.org/)
