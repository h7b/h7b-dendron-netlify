ref: [The Poor Swiss](https://thepoorswiss.com/how-to-choose-index-fund-etf/)

Key takeaways:

- Total Expense Ratio (TER)
- Assets under Management (AUM)
- Number of stocks (underlying portfolio of stocks in ETF)

    - it could be good to know that you can liquidate your shares at the best price
- Fund Domicile
- Dividend Distribution policy
- Replication Technique
    - **Physical replication** is safer than synthetic method
    - With Physical replication technique, prefer a **Full Replication** fund rather than a Sampling fund

## What to look for when buying ETFs
ref: [sharesight](https://www.sharesight.com/blog/what-to-look-for-when-buying-etfs/)

- ETF management fees
- Bid/Ask spreads
    - Low fees are one thing, but are meaningless if the cost of buying and selling an ETF is too high
    - A cost of buying ETFs that is not easily seen by the investor is the bid/ask spread. This is the difference an ETF can be bought or sold for. The ‘spread’ in the middle is essentially the profit margin made by the ‘market maker’, which is the entity who creates the ETF units.
    - Bid/Ask spread is generally driven by a couple of factors
        - The size and liquidity of the ETF. Bigger ETFs generally have a lower bid/ask spread.
        - The size and liquidity of the underlying market. Larger and more liquid markets generally have a lower bid/ask spread.
    - The spreads can be compared by simply checking the market depth on the buy and sell side with the difference being the spread
    - For large, liquid markets, you should try to keep bid/ask spreads under 0.10%. For smaller and less liquid markets, this may be as high as 0.30% (Australian market)
- ETF size
    - ETFs that are larger in size can have lower Bid/Ask spreads than their smaller counterparts
    - advantage that size gets you is reduced risk of an ETF closing
    - We always look for a market capitalisation of at least $50 million before investing in an ETF (Australian market)
- When and how to buy and sell
    - Rule 1: Never buy in the first and last 20 minutes of trading for the day
    - Rule 2: Always use a limit price
        - This is particularly relevant if placing large trades. Unlike normal equities, the market depth that you will see on your broker screen is not the full list of buyers and sellers. A market maker can ‘create’ new ETF units, by buying the underlying assets and turning them into an ETF unit. By using a limit price you’ll give the market maker time to create new units and fulfil your order. A market price on the other hand will fill your order in order of what is shown in the market depth and not give the market maker time to fulfil your order at the better price.
        - Set your limit to the lowest sell price (if buying) or highest buy price (if selling).
- ETF management type
    - Passive ETFs
    - Smart Beta ETFs
        - aka Factor or Strategic Beta ETFs, these track alternative indexes
        - Throwing away the traditional market capitalisation weighted indexes, Smart Beta index look at other factors when developing their index. This may include things like equal weighting, high yield strategies, certain market niches, and ethical investing
    - Active ETFs

## How To Pick an ETF

Ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/exchangetradedfunds/08/etf-choose-best.asp)


### Key Takeaways

-   As an investor, buying ETFs can be a smart and low-cost strategy to build an optimal portfolio.

### Narrowing a Wide Selection of ETFs

The wide array of choices in the ETFs space exist. These include traditional index ETFs based on U.S. and international [equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp) indexes and [subindexes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subindex.asp), but also those that track benchmark indices in [bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp), [commodities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp), and [futures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp). There are ETFs based on [investing style](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentstyle.asp) (value, growth, or a combination thereof) and that segregate by [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp). You will also find leveraged ETFs that provide multiples in return (or loss) based on the underlying index's movements, or inverse ETFs that rise when the market falls and vice-versa.

### Picking the Right ETF

Given the bewildering number of ETF choices that investors now have to contend with, it's important to consider the following factors:

-   **Level of Assets:** To be considered a viable investment choice, an ETF should have a minimum level of assets, a common threshold being at least **$10 million**. An ETF with assets below this threshold is likely to have a limited degree of investor interest. As with a stock, limited investor interest translates into poor [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) and wide [spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spread.asp).
-   **Trading Activity**: An investor needs to check if the ETF that is being considered trades in sufficient volume on a daily basis. Trading volume in the most popular ETFs runs into millions of shares daily; on the other hand, some ETFs barely trade at all. Trading volume is an excellent indicator of liquidity, regardless of the asset class. Generally speaking, the higher the trading volume for an ETF, the more liquid it is likely to be and the tighter the bid-ask spread. These are especially important considerations when it is time to exit the ETF.
-   **Underlying Index or Asset**: Consider the underlying [index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index.asp) or [asset class](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp) on which the ETF is based. From the point of view of [diversification](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diversification.asp), it may be preferable to invest in an ETF that is based on a broad, widely followed index, rather than an obscure index that has a narrow industry or geographic focus.
-   **Tracking Error**: While most ETFs track their underlying indexes closely, some do not track them as closely as they should. All else being equal, an ETF with minimal [tracking error](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trackingerror.asp) is preferable to one with a greater degree of error.
-   **Market Position**: "[First-mover](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/firstmover.asp) advantage" is important in the ETF world, because the first ETF issuer for a particular sector has a decent probability of garnering the lion's share of assets, before others jump on the bandwagon. It is therefore prudent to avoid ETFs that are mere imitations of an original idea, because they may not differentiate themselves from their rivals and attract investors' assets.

### In Case of ETF Liquidations

The closing, or liquidation, of an ETF is usually an orderly process. The ETF issuer will notify investors, generally three to four weeks in advance, about the date when the ETF will stop trading. That said, an investor with a position in an ETF that is being liquidated still has to decide on the best course of action in order to protect his or her investment. Essentially, the investor has to make one of the following choices:

-   **Sell the ETF shares before the "stop trading" date**: This is a proactive approach that may be suitable in cases where the investor believes that there is a significant risk of a substantial near-term decline in the ETF. In such cases, the investor may be willing to overlook the wide [bid-ask spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp) that are likely to be prevalent for the ETF, due to its limited liquidity.
-   **Hold on to the ETF shares until liquidation**: This alternative may be suitable if the ETF is invested in a sector that is not volatile and the [downside risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downsiderisk.asp) is minimal. The investor may have to wait a couple of weeks for the issuer to complete the process of selling the securities held within the ETF, and distributing the [net proceeds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netproceeds.asp) after expenses. Holding on for the liquidated value eliminates the issue of the bid-ask spread.

Regardless of the course of action, the investor will have to contend with the issue of taxes arising from the liquidation of the ETF investment. For example, if the ETF was held in a taxable account, the investor will be responsible for paying taxes on any [capital gains](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp).

### The Bottom Line

When selecting an ETF, investors should consider factors such as its level of assets, trading volume and underlying index. In the event that an ETF is to be liquidated, an investor has to decide whether to sell the ETF shares before it stops trading or wait until the liquidation process is completed, with due consideration given to the tax aspects of the ETF sale.
