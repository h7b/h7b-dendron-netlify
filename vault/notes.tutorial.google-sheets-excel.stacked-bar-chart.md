# How to create a Stacked Bar Chart

ref: [Chartio](https://chartio.com/learn/charts/stacked-bar-chart-complete-guide/), [The Data Visualisation Catalogue](https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/stacked_bar_graph.html)

Stacked Bar Graphs are used to show how a larger category is divided into smaller categories and what the relationship of each part has on the total amount.

100% Stack Bar Graphs show the percentage-of-the-whole of each group and are plotted by the percentage of each value to the total amount in each group. This makes it easier to see the relative differences between quantities in each group.
