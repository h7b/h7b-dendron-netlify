## Notes from reading

they are types of investment accounts, in which you can invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc. The reason these accounts are so important is that they have significant tax advantages over regular, fully taxable accounts.

Taxable Accounts
- Interest that you receive is taxed as ordinary income
- Most dividend income is taxed at a maximum tax rate of 20%
- Capital gains are taxed at a maximum rate of 20% if you’ve held the asset for more than one year, and taxed at your ordinary income tax rate if you’ve held the asset for one year or less

Traditional IRAs
- “tax-deduction-now, taxable-withdrawals-later” structure
    - when you contribute money to a traditional IRA, you usually get a tax deduction for the amount of the contribution
    - as long as the money remains in the account, it grows tax-free
    - when you do take money out of the account, the entire withdrawal is taxable as ordinary income
- traditional IRAs are often referred to as “tax-deferred” accounts
- restrictions
    - annual limit $5,500

Roth IRAs
- The biggest difference between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA is that you do not get a deduction for contributions to a Roth IRA. Instead, when you take money out of your Roth IRA.

401(k) Plans
- A 401(k) plan, named after subsection 401(k) of the tax code, is a retirement plan through which an employee can choose to have some of her wages/salary deposited into a tax-deferred investment account. In other words, having a 401(k) is a lot like having a traditional IRA provided by your employer
- 401(k) accounts have much higher contribution limits than IRAs
    - annual limit $18,000
