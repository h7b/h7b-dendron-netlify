# Relative Strength Index (RSI)

ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp)

The relative strength index (RSI) is a popular momentum oscillator developed in 1978.

The RSI measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. An asset is usually considered overbought when the RSI is above 70% and oversold when it is below 30%.
