## Notes from reading

ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tokenized-equity.asp)  
Tokenized equity refers to the creation and issuance of digital tokens or "coins" that represent equity shares in a corporation or organization.

The underlying blockchain infrastructure also supports all necessary activities applicable to the tokenized equity shares. For example, all popular corporate actions like dividends, mergers, and acquisitions, and other activities like shareholder voting and follow-on equity sale offers are also handled by the necessary blockchain system.

For instance, [Templum](https://www.templuminc.com/) is one such blockchain-based platform that is aiming to become the leading regulatory-compliant platform for tokenized asset offerings and their secondary trading.

**What exactly is traded on FTX?**

FTX itself lists tokens on the equities.  For instance, ftx.com/trade/TSLA/USD is a market to trade tokens on Tesla stock.

These spot tokens are backed by shares of Tesla stock custodied by CM-Equity.  They can be redeemed with CM-Equity for the underlying shares if desired.

**How are corporate actions handled?**

Holding tokenized stocks on FTX entitles users to dividends, etc. of the underlying stock.  FTX will pursue all reasonable actions to have the tokens on FTX reflect the corporate actions of the underlying equities, including through dividends and stock splits.  It is not anticipated that the shares will exercise their voting rights but CM-Equity may do so in its discretion.
