# Idea of app design

I want to build an app for wealth management sector.

Some interesting UI/UX that inspired me to implement

[Percento](https://www.percento.app/)
- distribution of assets
  ![asset-distribution](https://ik.imagekit.io/casa/h7b-dendron/2022-02-03_percento_IMG_0423_leWFPuqvQ.PNG?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1643855111674){max-width: 300px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}
- history of transactions
  ![history-of-transaction](https://ik.imagekit.io/casa/h7b-dendron/2022-02-03_percento_IMG_0426_GEx7jLTfC.PNG?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1643855112014){max-width: 300px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}
- list of account, bird view
![list-of-accounts](https://ik.imagekit.io/casa/h7b-dendron/2022-02-03_percento_IMG_0424_Zd1-ZrgiK.PNG?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1643855111666){max-width: 300px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}
- list of accounts, detail view
![list-of-accounts-in-details](https://ik.imagekit.io/casa/h7b-dendron/2022-02-03_percento_IMG_0425_1q_y-lQJ7.PNG?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1643855111818){max-width: 300px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}

[Portfolio Performance](https://www.portfolio-performance.info/en/)
- open source tool to calculate the overall performance of an investment portfolio - across all accounts
- [tutorial](http://indexfundinvestor.eu/2019/06/27/how-to-track-your-investments-with-portfolio-performance/) by [Index Fund (European) Investor](https://indexfundinvestor.eu/)

[Composer](https://www.composer.trade/)
- a no code platform for creating and investing with rules-based trading strategies. They have dozens of [pre-made investing templates](https://app.composer.trade/discover). But you can also build your own strategy
- Composer removes the subjectivity of buying breakouts and then having to make decisions during the heat of the moment. Iâ€™m all about rules-based investing
- With Composer you can create, backtest and invest in your own quant strategy - no code, spreadsheets or Terminal required
