## [Vanguard Financials ETF (VFH)](https://etfdb.com/etf/VFH/#etf-ticker-profile)

## [Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)](https://etfdb.com/etf/VOO/#etf-ticker-profile)

## [Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)](https://etfdb.com/etf/QQQ/#etf-ticker-profile)

The Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (Fund) is based on the NASDAQ-100 Index (Index). The Fund will invest at least 90% of its total assets in the securities that comprise the Index. The Index includes securities of 100 of the largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on Nasdaq. The Fund and Index are rebalanced quarterly and reconstituted annually.

QQQ was structured as trusts. Trusts, unlike many other equity ETFs,
- can’t lend out the stocks in their portfolio, and use the revenue to help offset fees
- They also can’t reinvest dividends, which many buy-and-hold savers prefer

Big institutional investors and high-speed firms will likely stick with QQQ, at least for now; the larger size makes QQQ cheaper to trade, and the QQQ has a sizable lead when it comes to liquidity.

- Expense Ratio: 0.20%
- Inception: 1999-03-10
- NAV as of 05/02/2022: $318.82

## [Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM)](https://etfdb.com/etf/QQQM/#etf-ticker-profile)

QQQM is virtually identical to Invesco’s QQQ Trust (QQQ).

For the buy-and-hold saver, the mini-Q is likely the more appealing option: lower fees, smaller share price, reinvested dividends.

- Expense Ratio: 0.15%
- Inception: 2020-10-13
- NAV as of 05/02/2022: $131.24
