## Alternative methods to publish Obsidian vault

Obsidian is great but finding a way to publish my Obsidian vault without purchasing `Obsidian Publish` [subscription](https://obsidian.md/publish) is a fun experiment though.

- [[Use MkDocs|notes.tutorial.tools-for-thought.mkdocs-publish]]
    - Thoughts: has dark theme, built-in navigation bar, search feature, tags in notes not yet supported. My current favorite approach.
- [MdToNotion](https://github.com/Layjoo/MdToNotion)script to publish notes to Notion page using Notion API
    - Discussion in [Obsidian forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/publish-obsidian-note-using-notion/27227)
- [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)
    - Discussion in [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/onflb9/quartz_create_and_publish_your_obsidian_vault_for/)
    - Thoughts: has graph view, backlink, hard to navigation between notes since navigation bar are not built in, imho the acknowledgement footer are so intrusive
- [Digital garden Jekyll template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template)
    - Thoughts: minimalist style, not my type
- [Jekyll Garden](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io) template
    - Discussion in [Obsidian forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/jekyll-garden-new-jekyll-theme-for-obsidian-users/23296)
    - Thoughts: lack of graph view, no navigation on left pane, has top menu bar. Not my type.
- [Gatsby And Digital Garden](https://github.com/mathieudutour/gatsby-digital-garden/)
    - Thoughts: nice dark theme, use sliding pane style but doesn't have a button to close panes, not easy to navigate between notes cause of lacking of navigation bar
- [Eleventy-Garden](https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden)
    - Thougths: minimalist style, not my type

    - Showcase: [Mara-Li blog](https://owlly-house.netlify.app/)
    - Thoughts: looks neat, has navigation bar, tags, search, but the navigation bar always collapse when a note is clicked
