# Typical workflow of Obsidian users

## Project note by `@zsviczian`

- Explanation clip on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIKg_1FNUgk)
- Scripts on [GitHub](https://gist.github.com/zsviczian/fd3fcae4e2c4fa2be668756dca59da06)
- Thoughts: 
    - author has interesting way to transclude tasks, working notes, contacts from daily notes into topic and project
    - he uses [Templater](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/) script to achieve some task automation
