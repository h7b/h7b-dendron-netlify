# Database

- GitHub: https://github.com/tomaszkiewicz/obsidian-database-plugin
- Thoughts:
    - this is an alternative of [[Database Folder|notes.tutorial.obsidian-md.plugins.database-folder]], since they share the same concept of rendering markdown files contained in 1 folder as a table database in Obsidian
    - this plugin is powered by [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) and [Vuetify](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify)
