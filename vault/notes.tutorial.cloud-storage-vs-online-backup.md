# Cloud Storage vs Online Backup: What’s The Difference

ref: [Cloudwards](https://www.cloudwards.net/online-storage-vs-online-backup-whats-the-difference/)

## The Difference

I curated my own [list of pricing plans](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1enE0KFKkUm9rvMB4zG1A8Qn5OlCTEswAAe7ztVlvoHo/edit?usp=sharing) of cloud storage and online backup services.

Cloud storage solution: 
- The vital purpose of cloud storage is to supplement your hard drive. Cloud storage is an extension of the physical storage capability of your device
- Sync: cloud storage feature that lets you edit a file on one device and have those edits reflected on another device in near real-time
- Share: the ability to let others view, edit or download files you’ve uploaded to your cloud storage space
- Cloud storage solutions are not really suitable for hard-drive backup since they don’t retain your file-system structure because you end up having to put everything into a sync folder.

Online backup services:
- Aim to replicate your hard drive, for disaster recovery.
- Retain your file system structure and let you restore everything back the way it was in case you need to rebuild your hard drive

Another funny written [marketing piece from Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-case-for-backup-over-sync/) comparing their backup solution vs other sync services, might give the reason to consider to buy their subscription
