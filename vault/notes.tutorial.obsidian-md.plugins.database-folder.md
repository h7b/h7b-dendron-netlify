# Database Folder

- GitHub: https://github.com/RafaelGB/obsidian-db-folder
- Thoughts:
    - This plugin renders markdown files contained in 1 folder as a table database in Obsidian
    - This plugin is powered by [[Dataview|notes.tutorial.obsidian-md.plugins.dataview]] as search engine, [react-table](https://github.com/TanStack/react-table) and [editable-react-table](https://github.com/archit-p/editable-react-table)
    - I considered this as a way to create a *table database* in Obsidian (similar to a *table database* in Notion)
    - [Article](https://thomasjfrank.com/notion-simple-tables/) which compare a *table database* vs *simple table* in Notion
