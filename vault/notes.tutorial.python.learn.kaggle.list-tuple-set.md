# The differences b/w list vs tuple vs set

All are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

## List
```python
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```
- Created using square brackets
- List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
- List items are indexed, the first item has index `[0]`

## Tuple
```python
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
```
- Created using round brackets
- Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values

## Set
```python
myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
```
- Created using curly brackets
- Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values
