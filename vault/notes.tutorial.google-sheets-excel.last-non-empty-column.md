# Find the Last Non-Empty Column in a Row in Google Sheets
ref: [infoinspired](https://infoinspired.com/google-docs/spreadsheet/last-non-empty-column-in-a-row-in-google-sheets/)

Situation: I want to find the last used column number of the row#3
![situation-example](https://infoinspired.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Last-Used-Column.gif){max-width: 300px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}

How to do: a workaround using [MATCH function](https://infoinspired.com/google-docs/spreadsheet/match-function-in-google-sheets/)
```javascript
=ArrayFormula(MATCH(2,1/(A3:3<>"")))
```

Explain:
1. the key element is the array generated by `1/(A3:3<>"")`
 if we put the formula in cell `A4`
  ```javascript
  =ArrayFormula(1/(A3:3<>""))
  ```
  the output will be
![generated-array](https://infoinspired.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Last-Value-Logic-Sheets.jpg){max-width: 300px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}
  Meaning of this formula: returns the number 1 wherever the cells in row#3 have values, else `#DIV/0!` error
2. next is the MATCH function
  ```javascript
  match(2,1/(A3:3<>""))
  ```
  The formula would return the largest value less than or equal to the `search_key` (number 2) from the A-Z sorted `range` (the array generated in step 1 above)  
  Since the `search_key` number 2 is not available in the generated array, the MATCH function will then search for the largest number less than 2, which is 1.  
  Since there are multiple cells containing the number 1, the formula would return the relative position of the last cell containing the number 1
