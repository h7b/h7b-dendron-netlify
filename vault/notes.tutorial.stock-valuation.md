# Stock valuation method
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/11/choosing-valuation-methods.asp)

2 categories of valuation models
- absolute
  - attempt to find the intrinsic or "true" value of an investment based only on fundamentals, such things as dividends, cash flow, and the growth rate for a single company and not worry about any other companies
  - notable method: Discounted Cash Flow model (DCF) and its variations, Dividend Discount Model (DDM)
- relative
  - compare the company in question to other similar companies. These methods involve calculating multiples and ratios, such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, and comparing them to the multiples of similar companies

## Comparables Model

The comparable analysis is an example of relative stock valuation. It compares the stock's price multiples to a benchmark to determine if the stock is relatively undervalued or overvalued

Commonly used multiples
