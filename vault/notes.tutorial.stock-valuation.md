# Stock valuation method
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/11/choosing-valuation-methods.asp)

2 categories of valuation models
- absolute
  - attempt to find the intrinsic or "true" value of an investment based only on fundamentals, such things as dividends, cash flow, and the growth rate for a single company and not worry about any other companies
  - notable method: dividend discount model (DDM), discounted cash flow model (DCF)
- relative
  - compare the company in question to other similar companies. These methods involve calculating multiples and ratios, such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, and comparing them to the multiples of similar companies

## Comparables Model

The comparable analysis is an example of relative stock valuation. It compares the stock's price multiples to a benchmark to determine if the stock is relatively undervalued or overvalued

Commonly used multiples
- [[Enterprise value|notes.tutorial.stock-valuation.entreprise-value]] multiples
  - features:
    - enterprise value multiples allow for direct comparison of different firms, regardless of capital structure
    - enterprise valuation multiples are typically less affected by accounting differences
  - enterprise-value-to-sales ratio (EV/sales)
  - [[EV/EBIT|notes.tutorial.stock-valuation.ev-ebit]]
  - [[EV/EBITDA|notes.tutorial.stock-valuation.ev-ebitda]]
- Equity multiples
  - features:
    - equity multiples can be artificially impacted by a change in capital structure, even when there is no change in enterprise value (EV)
    - equity multiples are more commonly used by investors because they can be calculated easily and are readily available via most financial websites
  - price-to-earnings (P/E)
  - price-to-book (P/B)
  - price-to-sales (P/S)
  - price-to-cash flow (P/CF)
  - Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG)

- Working Capital Ratio
- Quick Ratio
- Earnings per Share (EPS)
- Debt-Equity Ratio
- Return on Equity (ROE)

## Dividend Discount Model (DDM)
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/ddm.asp)

The DDM model is based on the theory that the value of a company is the present worth of the sum of all of its future dividend payments

### Shortcomings of the DDM
- The model assumes a constant dividend growth rate in perpetuity
  - DDM may not be the best model to value newer companies that have fluctuating dividend growth rates or no dividend at all
- The second issue with the DDM is that the output is very sensitive to the inputs
- The model also fails when companies may have a lower rate of return (r) compared to the dividend growth rate (g). This may happen when a company continues to pay dividends even if it is incurring a loss or relatively lower earnings

## Discounted Cash Flow Model (DCF)
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp)

DCF analysis attempts to figure out the value of an investment today, based on projections of how much money it will generate in the future
