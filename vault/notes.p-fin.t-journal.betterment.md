# Betterment

My current experiment with robo-advisor Betterment. 

Thoughts:
- Nothing impressive
- My current portfolio of 90% stocks and 10% bonds has weaker performance vs market index (S&P500) within the same timeframe
- Low management fee vs certain mutual fund. But still more expensive than ETF provider like Vanguard
- Tax-loss-harvesting feature did not justify its value
- Tax statements provided by Betterment are clear and concise. Though I don't have experience with other institutions, so this is opinionated
- Will it be more cost-effective if I find a way to hold directly Vanguard ETF?
