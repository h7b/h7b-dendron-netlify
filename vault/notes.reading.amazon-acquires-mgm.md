## Notes from reading

The news itself is nothing special, just proving the fact that 
- streaming services will be balkanized, 
- consumers need to unhappily subscribe to many concurrent providers to watch all the shows they have interest in, like the old days of cable TV

With such hindrance, would the trend of content piracy resurrect?

Nowadays, nobody with average knowledge will use open source bittorrent client like [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) or [BiglyBT](https://www.biglybt.com/) to search for pirated content, because of legal issues. 
- They can search for private free or paid Plex server in [Plex shares reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/plexshares/)
- Or spin up a personal media server using [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/)
