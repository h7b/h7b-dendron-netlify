- [Annotation basics](https://web.hypothes.is/help/annotation-basics/)
- [annotation vs highlight vs Page Notes](https://web.hypothes.is/help/whats-the-difference-between-an-annotation-and-a-highlight/)
- [highlights are private by default](https://web.hypothes.is/help/why-are-highlights-private-by-default/)
- Be aware that when the text to which the annotations anchored has vanished, Hypothesis can no longer attach them. These unanchored annotations become [orphan](https://web.hypothes.is/help/the-contents-of-a-web-page-i-annotated-changed-and-my-annotations-are-gone-what-can-i-do/). They are displayed in a separate section of the sidebar
