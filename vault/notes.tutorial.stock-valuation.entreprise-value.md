# Enterprise Value (EV)
ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevalue.asp)

Enterprise value (EV) is a measure of a company's total value, often used as a more comprehensive alternative to equity market capitalization.

Enterprise value includes in its calculation the market capitalization of a company but also short-term and long-term debt as well as any cash on the company's balance sheet.

$$EV = MC + Total Debt − C$$

where:
- $MC$ = Market Capitalization; equal to the current stock price multiplied by the number of outstanding stock shares. MC represents a company's value as determined by market participants.
- $Total Debt$ = equal to the sum of short-term and long-term debt
- $C$ = Cash and cash equivalents

Enterprise value (EV) could be thought of like the theoretical takeover price if a company were to be bought

## Why Is Cash Deducted From Enterprise Value?
To understand why cash is deducted from enterprise value, suppose that you are a private investor wishing to purchase 100% of a publicly-traded company. When planning your purchase, you note that the company’s market capitalization is $100 million, meaning you will need $100 million to buy all the shares from its existing shareholders. But what if the company also has $20 million in cash? In that scenario, your real “cost” for purchasing the company would only be $80 million, since buying the company would immediately give you access to its $20 million in cash. All else being equal, a higher cash balance leads to a lower enterprise value, and vice-versa.

## Why Is Debt Added to Enterprise Value?
Higher debt leads to a higher enterprise value because it represents an added cost that must be paid by any would-be acquirer. For instance, in our previous example, suppose that the company has $10 million in debt. With that in mind, you now know that in addition to the $100 million you need to purchase the shares from its existing shareholders, you also need an additional $10 million to pay off the company’s debts. Putting these figures together, your total enterprise value would be $100 million in market capitalization, plus $10 million in debt, minus $20 million in cash, for a total of $90 million.
