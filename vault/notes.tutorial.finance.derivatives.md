## Introduction

Equity, fixed- income, currency, and commodity markets are facilities for trading the basic assets of an economy. 
- Equity and fixed- income securities are claims on the assets of a company. 
- Currencies are the monetary units issued by a government or central bank. 
- Commodities are natural resources, such as oil or gold. 
- These underlying assets are said to trade in **cash markets** or **spot markets** and their prices are sometimes referred to as **cash prices** or **spot prices**, though we usually just refer to them as stock prices, bond prices, exchange rates, and commodity prices.

A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its performance from the performance of an underlying asset. 
- The so- called "underlying asset" is often simply referred to as the underlying, whose value is the source of risk

Derivatives are similar to insurance in that both allow for the transfer of risk from one party to another.
- like insurance, derivatives pay off on the basis of a source of risk
- like insurance, derivatives have a definite life span and expire on a specified date

Derivatives are created in the form of legal contracts. They involve two parties—the buyer and the seller (sometimes known as the writer)—each of whom agrees to do something for the other, either now or later. 
- The buyer, who purchases the derivative, is referred to as the **long** or the holder because he owns (holds) the derivative and holds a long position 
- The seller is referred to as the **short** because he holds a short position

There are two general classes of derivatives
- **forward commitments**: provide the ability to lock in a price at which one might buy or sell the underlying. They force the two parties to transact in the future at a previously agreed-on price. The various types of forward commitments are called forward contracts, futures contracts, and swaps
- **contingent claims**: provide the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying at a pre-determined price. The choice of buying or selling versus doing nothing depends on a particular random (contingent) outcome. The primary contingent claim is called an **option**

Derivatives generally trade at lower transaction costs than comparable spot market transactions, are often more liquid than their underlyings, and offer a simple, effective, and low-cost way to transfer risk.
