# Hey ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my digital garden. 

I use this as a frictionless way to 
- learn in public
- share my thoughts without being constrained to long, polished blog posts
- write ideas and quickly reference my notes

> [Digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) are imperfect by design. They don't hide their rough edges or claim to be a permanent source of truth

Feel free to drop an email at `h(at)kool(dot)casa` or start a [discussion in GitHub](https://github.com/h7b/h7b-dendron-netlify/discussions/1).

Current build:
- this static site is published using [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/), deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- articles are plain *Markdown* files located in the `vault` directory, inside a GitHub repo
- each *Markdown* file has a *yaml* frontmatter for storing metadata
- the URL for each note is determined by the `id` key in the `frontmatter`.
