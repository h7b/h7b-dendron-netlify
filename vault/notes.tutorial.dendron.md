# Write and publish notes using Dendron

[[Workflow|notes.tutorial.dendron.publish-netlify]] to publish vault by deploying via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and notes are stored as md files in GitHub private repo.
- My favorite method
- Much better, both in execution time, number of keystroke, size of local folder on disk and manual effort, vs the workflow of [[publishing via GitHub Pages|notes.tutorial.dendron.publish-github-pages]]
- with this Netlify workflow, I just need to push updated contents to GitHub repo with command `Dendron: Workspace: Sync`, and all of the built process will be executed automatically by Netlify.

I use Obsidian on iOS with [[Breadcrumbs plugin|notes.tutorial.obsidian-md.hierarchical-notes]] to view and edit my Dendron vault on iPhone.

An illustration that helps me to understand the concept of workspace, local vault, remote vault, and how they mingle in Dendron.
