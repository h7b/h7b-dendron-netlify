# Tokenized stocks

ref: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tokenized-equity.asp)  
Tokenized equity refers to the creation and issuance of digital tokens or "coins" that represent equity shares in a corporation or organization.

The underlying blockchain infrastructure also supports all necessary activities applicable to the tokenized equity shares. For example, all popular corporate actions like dividends, mergers, and acquisitions, and other activities like shareholder voting and follow-on equity sale offers are also handled by the necessary blockchain system.

For instance, [Templum](https://www.templuminc.com/) is one such blockchain-based platform that is aiming to become the leading regulatory-compliant platform for tokenized asset offerings and their secondary trading.

**What exactly is traded on FTX?**

FTX itself lists tokens on the equities.  For instance, ftx.com/trade/TSLA/USD is a market to trade tokens on Tesla stock.

These spot tokens are backed by shares of Tesla stock custodied by CM-Equity.  They can be redeemed with CM-Equity for the underlying shares if desired.

**How are corporate actions handled?**

Holding tokenized stocks on FTX entitles users to dividends, etc. of the underlying stock.  FTX will pursue all reasonable actions to have the tokens on FTX reflect the corporate actions of the underlying equities, including through dividends and stock splits.  It is not anticipated that the shares will exercise their voting rights but CM-Equity may do so in its discretion.

Nasdaq’s feed, along with those of [Finnhub](https://finnhub.io/ "Finnhub home page"), will power services on [DeFiChain](https://defichain.com/ "DeFiChain home page"), a native decentralized finance blockchain for the Bitcoin network devoted to monetary applications and services  
DeFiChain will offer tokenized stocks corresponding to the underlying price of listed companies such as Apple Inc., Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and GameStop Corp. The tokenized stocks will be collateralized by cryptocurrencies, which means traders won’t have to go through an intermediary such as a broker.  
Tokenized stocks can be purchased in fractions in the form of decentralized loans. This system will power the stock trading mechanics on DeFiChain in a trustless manner and will use DeFiChain’s native digital currency -- DFI -- as well as Bitcoin and USD Coin, among other cryptocurrencies.

**DeFi tokenized stock trading doesn’t offer any ownership of the underlying asset**. Instead, it is a tokenized representation of a stock that, in part, mirrors the underlying asset’s price. It can be traded 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Outside of the United States, in many countries, investors don’t have easy access to U.S. securities markets or, if they do, it is a costly proposition.

Depending on the exchange, tokenized stock may or may not have collateral behind it. 
- The tokenized stock without collateral is a synthetic security that the crypto exchange or intermediary writes into existence on a blockchain somewhere. 
    - This matters because if that ‘somewhere’ is in Minsk, Ukraine or some remote tiny island. Investors may not have much recourse if the service provider hurts investors. 
    - Crypto exchanges offering tokenized stocks without collateral include Currency.com and others.
- crypto exchanges with collateralized stock tokens, such as: FTX, Binance, and Bittrex Global.

There are other important nuances for would-be investors, such as whether or not owning a tokenized stock gives you ownership rights to get paid stock dividends and be able to vote as a shareholder. For example, Binance states on its website that “holding stock tokens does not transfer any shareholder rights to you” whereas FTX and Bittrex report being committed on a ‘best-efforts’ basis to see tokenized stock holders receive stock dividends.

**So, what exactly does one own when clicking ‘buy’ for these novel tokenized stocks?**

The short answer is you own a collateralized digital derivative product that can be traded much like the spot instrument, i.e. the share or ‘real thing’.A derivative security references its value from a separate security that trades in the cash market. Both the derivative and spot instrument can generate profits and losses in lockstep in someone’s trading account.

**The Demise of CFDs?**

One way to understand the significance of collateralized asset issuance is to compare it to what it might be replacing. One of the potentially disruptive qualities of tokenized securities is that they [could](https://financefeeds.com/are-tokenized-stocks-a-new-threat-to-the-fx-cfd-industry/ "https://financefeeds.com/are-tokenized-stocks-a-new-threat-to-the-fx-cfd-industry/") steamroll the large retail FX and Contract for Difference (CFD) industry, which is well established and generally offers tradable instruments that are not saved to a blockchain. Broadly speaking, CFD brokers also lag crypto exchanges in terms of crypto sophistication and product depth. For example, CFD’s - which are not available in the United States - have long let users trade a synthetic instrument mimicking Apple or Microsoft stock prices, but are, at heart, IOUs issued by a retail broker, not traded on exchange, and non-transferable. The adaptability of well capitalized CFD retail brokerage firms such as IG, CMC Markets, and Plus500 should not be underestimated, however.

**Tokenized Stocks Trading Conditions**

While on the surface a tokenized Apple stock is traded in multiple exchanges, you should know that any tokenized stocks can only be traded in one crypto exchange. For example, AAPL/USD is the ticker name in the FTX platform, while Binance uses the AAPL/BUSD ticker, and Currency.com the AAPL.cx ticker. Try to transfer your AAPL/BUSD or AAPL.cx securities to FTX and you will be informed that the stock token is not portable to other crypto exchanges or to your local brokerage firm where you have your securities portfolio. “It would be really powerful to be able to freely move tokenized stocks on the blockchain, but as of now FTX and \[German financial services firm\] CM-Equity do not support that. They remain on FTX, a tied agent to CM-Equity,” indicated FTX’s Bankman-Fried.

Best case scenario, investors trade with ease the tokenized stock at any time without a glitch. Worst case scenario, the value of the investment resides digitally at a firm that may not offer the service tomorrow or could be at risk if the other intermediary firms went out of business. In the U.S. stock owners are protected from the risk that a brokerage firm is put out of business by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), a non-profit run by U.S.-based registered broker-dealers. To our knowledge, no such protection exists in the world of tokenized stocks, in part because this type of security is so new.

**Collateralization 101: A Tokenized Stock Is Born**

The collateralized tokenized stocks hitting the market are mainly originating from two European firms working together in different capacities to serve various crypto exchanges. CM-Equity AG  describes itself as a “fully-licensed capital markets infrastructure platform” and acts as brokers to the crypto exchanges. A separate company in this financial engineering, Swiss-based Digital Assets AG describes itself as a “boutique firm focused on the issuance of tokenized financial products.”

The client owns the COIN token issued by Digital Assets AG and custodied by FTX. FTX specifies in its website that, at the users’ discretion, CM-Equity can honor a redemption of the spot token for the actual share of stock. By contrast, Binance, states that stock tokens are “generally redeemable from the issuer” and that a special redemption fee may apply and that the redemption is “generally settled in stablecoin”.

**What is Counterparty Risk in Owning This Type of Security?**

Counterparty risk is the non-compliance risk in a transaction, such as between an investor and the brokerage firm or exchange holding a security on behalf of the investor. It doesn’t occur often, but at times brokerage firms and crypto exchanges may cease doing business. The tokenized stocks a client may hold could be unreachable or unusable outside of the issuing party, even if written to a blockchain.

There are numerous risks associated with stock tokens, including 
- not being able to redeem the digital token
- significant adverse price slippage for trading during illiquid hours
- or not being able to receive a fair treatment related to corporate actions.
