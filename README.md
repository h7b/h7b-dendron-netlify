# Blog - mes belles lettres

This is the source code for my personal blog and notes.

The site is published using [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/), deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

Articles are plain *Markdown* files located in the `vault` directory. Each *Mardown* file also has a *yaml* frontmatter for storing metadata. The URL for each article is determined by the `id` in the `frontmatter`.
